convnet-nu-discovery
====================

Based off cuda-convnet2, this framework for fast convolutional neural networks
is ported to run on Northeastern University's Discovery Cluster.


Still in progress!
------------------

As part of coursework for EECE 5640: High-Performance Computing, we are adapting
this framework for use on NU's Discovery Cluster, with the intention to increase
performance via CUDA, OpenMP and MPI.
